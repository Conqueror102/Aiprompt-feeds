# Fixes Applied - Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Editor Overlapping Text - FIXED
**Problem**: Text appearing on top of each other in the edit prompt interface
**Solution**: 
- Added `whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-auto break-words` to contentEditable div
- Added proper line break conversion when loading content: `data.content.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')`
- Fixed for both owner and non-owner editor views

**Files Changed**:
- `app/edit-prompt/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 147, 678, 885)

---

### 2. Run Button Opens AI Link - FIXED
**Problem**: Run button was opening chat interface instead of launching AI platforms
**Solution**:
- Changed `handleRunChat` to `handleRunWithAI`
- Now uses `launchExternalAgent` to open AI platforms directly
- Shows proper toast notifications for URL injection vs clipboard
- Button text changed from "Run Chat" to "Run with AI"

**Files Changed**:
- `components/PromptDetailModal.tsx` (lines 142-167, 381-385)

---

### 3. Button Order Changed to "Edit & Use" - FIXED
**Problem**: Buttons showed "Use & Edit" 
**Solution**: Changed text to "**Edit & Use**" in:
- PromptDetailModal three-dot menu
- PromptCardHeader dropdown menu
- Also moved Edit button to first position in modal

**Files Changed**:
- `components/PromptDetailModal.tsx` (line 350)
- `components/prompts/PromptCardHeader.tsx` (line 129)

---

### 4. Textarea Glitches - FIXED
**Problem**: Text overlapping in simple textareas
**Solution**: Added `resize-y overflow-auto` to textarea component

**Files Changed**:
- `components/ui/textarea.tsx` (line 12)

---

### 5. New AI Platforms Added - COMPLETED
Added 4 new AI platforms with proper URL injection and clipboard support:
- **v0** ‚ö° (URL injection)
- **Lovable** üíñ (URL injection)
- **Bolt** ‚ö° (URL injection)
- **Replit** üîß (Clipboard only)

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/constants.ts`
- `lib/ai-models-config.ts`
- `lib/launch-agent.ts`
- `components/AIAgentCollections.tsx`
- `components/AIAgentChat.tsx`
- `components/PromptCard.tsx`
- `components/DevModeInterface.tsx`

## üîß How Undo/Redo & Formatting Work

The edit prompt page uses `document.execCommand()` for formatting:
- **Undo/Redo**: Uses browser's built-in undo stack
- **Bullets**: `insertUnorderedList` command
- **Numbering**: `insertOrderedList` command
- **Bold/Italic**: Standard execCommand formatting

**Note**: `document.execCommand()` is deprecated but still widely supported. If you experience issues:
1. Try using Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y for undo/redo
2. Select text before applying formatting
3. Click inside the editor to focus it first

## üìù Text Editor Recommendation

**Current Setup**: Native `contentEditable` div with `document.execCommand()`

**Recommendation**: Keep the current setup for now because:
- ‚úÖ Works for your use case (prompt editing)
- ‚úÖ No extra dependencies
- ‚úÖ Fast and lightweight
- ‚úÖ Fixes applied resolve the glitches

**Consider upgrading ONLY if**:
- Users report frequent undo/redo failures
- You need advanced features (syntax highlighting, autocomplete)
- You want better mobile support

**Alternative Libraries** (if needed later):
1. **Monaco Editor** - Full VS Code experience (~3MB)
2. **CodeMirror 6** - Lightweight code editor (~500KB)
3. **Lexical** - Modern Facebook editor (~200KB)
